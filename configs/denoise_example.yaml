# Example configuration for denoising training

# Data parameters
data:
  train_dir: "data/train"  # Directory containing training images
  val_dir: "data/val"      # Directory containing validation images (optional)
  image_size: 256          # Target image size (256 or 512)
  batch_size: 8            # Batch size for training
  num_workers: 2           # Number of data loading workers

# Noise simulation parameters
noise:
  poisson_scale: 5.0       # Scale for Poisson noise (higher = less noise)
  gaussian_std: 0.05       # Standard deviation for Gaussian noise

# Model parameters
model:
  base_channels: 32        # Base number of channels (32 for lightweight, 64 for larger)
  in_channels: 1           # Input channels (1 for grayscale)
  out_channels: 1          # Output channels (1 for grayscale)

# Training parameters
training:
  epochs: 50               # Number of training epochs
  learning_rate: 0.001     # Initial learning rate
  weight_decay: 0.0001     # L2 regularization
  device: "auto"           # Device: "auto", "cuda", "cpu"
  
# Checkpoint and logging
output:
  checkpoint_dir: "artifacts"           # Directory for saving checkpoints
  checkpoint_name: "denoiser.pt"        # Name of the checkpoint file
  log_dir: "artifacts/logs"             # Directory for TensorBoard logs
  csv_log: "artifacts/training_log.csv" # CSV file for training metrics
  save_every: 5                          # Save checkpoint every N epochs
